## Summary {.smaller}

- Periodic and quasi-periodic can help reveal properties of underlying object.
- Three methods for discovering periodicity: Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), and Gaussian process regression
- Compare their results on two X-ray light curves from Swift that accompanied short gamma-ray bursts (sGRB).
- Found periodicity but needs to be confirmed
- Detrending was the biggest factor affecting the recovery of periods.
- Suggest X-rays originate from magnetar oscillations after binary merger or precession of newborn magnetar.

## Data

- 124 sGRBs in third Swift-BAT catalogue (12/2004--07/2019)
- 67 BAT light curves with SNR > 3
- Chose 2 light curves with sufficient data: 
  - GRB 050724
  - GRB 060614
- Used points from the initial WT (windowed timing) mode, not latter PC (photon counting) mode.

## Methodology (Raw light curve)

- Fit GP
  - Mean function: power law, polynomial.
  - kernel: quasiperiodic, simple harmonic oscillator, damped random walk.
- Inspect hyperparameters
  - period, P
  - quality factor, Q > 0.5

## Methodology (Detrending)

Detrend by subtracting from raw light curve:

- Fitted GP
  - Mean: power law, kernel: quasiperiodic.
  - Mean: power law, kernel: damped random walk.
  - Mean: polynomial, kernel: quasiperiodic.
  - Mean: polynomial, kernel: simple harmonic oscillator.
  - Mean: polynomial, kernel: damped random walk.
- Fitted polynomial

## Methodology (Detrended light curve)
   
- Fit GP
  - Mean function: constant.
  - kernel: quasiperiodic, damped random walk.
- Calculate L-S periodogram
- Apply WWZ-transform

## Conclusions

- Potential QPOs were detected.
- LSP, WWZ, and GPs seem consistent.
- Detrending has large influence, as does kernel and mean function.

## Comments

- No recommendations on which method to use and why.
- Spent too much time describing `celerite`, could just cite.
- Conclusion contradicts results.


## Statistical nitpicking

- Detrending is like enforcing stationarity
- Detrending itself is not trivial; what order polynomial was used?
  - equivalent to non-zero GP mean function
- Heavy selection bias (n = 2)
- Fitting Gaussian likelihood to X-ray count data
- LSP only looks for sinusoids
- Using MLE to initialise MCMC is good practice


## Hmmm...
